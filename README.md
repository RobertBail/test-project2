# Product Inventory Finder

Mainly a test project for React, seeing how it works.

Created a Product Inventory Finder with API data from https://dummyjson.com/products

Partly based on this article: https://dev.to/alais29dev/building-a-real-time-search-filter-in-react-a-step-by-step-guide-3lmm 

I was wondering how to perhaps hide the list until certain item/s are searched, if possible
